# x86 SPI Lockdown Kernel Module

This kernel module exposes the FLOCKDN bit on x86 systems via sysctl.

Enabling FLOCKDN prevents SPI protected memory range registers from being
modified. (See: Section 21.4.2 in IntelÂ® 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset
Family Platform Controller Hub (PCH) - Datasheet)

This module is meant to be used as part of a SecureBoot environment.
Where it is hardened such that there is no /dev/mem access or privileged
IO available. (because if you have those things you can just do this
from userspace)

Tested on debian, 3.16 kernel, and ICH10R LPC Interface
Controller

## Usage

* apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
* make
* insmod spi_lockdown.ko
* sysctl -w dev.spi_lockdown.flockdn=1

## TODO

* Review datasheets for all the chipsets dumped into lpc_chipsets :(
* Error handling and cleanup
* Support more ICH
* Expose SPI protected memory ranges
* Expose Flash Region Access Permissions Register
* Expose Software Sequencing Flash Control Register
* Expose flash descriptor region and mark unwritable
* Re-write register values on wakeup from sleep
* Instructions for statically linking into kernel
